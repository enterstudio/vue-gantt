# vue-gantt

**Gantt chart component for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)**

I'm author of [angular-gantt](https://www.angular-gantt.com/), a Gantt chart component for AngularJS, and this is 
currently a Work in Progress to port this component to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

It's the first time I use Vue, so this repository is also a playground to evaluate this library.

# Demo

Demo is available for [current development branch on rawgit](https://rawgit.com/Toilal/vue-gantt/develop/demo/index.html).

##Â Why not porting angular-gantt to Angular ?

It seems to make more sense today to build a component on a view only library instead of a full pledged 
framework. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) is one of the smallest library, so I hope there will soon be some viable solution to import a Vue.js 
component as an Angular module.

## Run from sources

- Install dependencies with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/fr/).

```bash
yarn install
```

- Run the development server.

```bash
yarn run serve
